# canim-kendim
The screen reads "CANIM KENDIM" and the font changes with each click. (canÄ±m kendim = my dear myself)

This is not a product of arrogance or narcissism. I got bored and thought, "Why don't I design a website that people just spend 30 seconds on and then close?" i said and i did :D

The font changes with each click and shows a short feedback animation to make the click stand out.
